# **Rafael Ruiz - test**

# Overview

Translating desing into code.

## Timeframe

4 Hours

# Brief

* Consistency and attention to detail. The product should be an accurate representation of the design provided.

* Maximum number of sections working and responsive.

* HTML and CSS technical abilities. The code should be well written and using common practices.
 
* Code architecture. The code should be readable and easy to evaluate.

* Talk about your project: technical choices, what could have been done/improved if you had more time, etc. (a README file seems a nice fit for that).

* There are no requirements for the tech stack. Vanilla HTML / CSS / JS is fine, as is any framework that you feel is appropriate.

* The source code should be delivered via GitHub (or similar)

* The project should be deployed online (have a look at surge.sh, zeit.co, netlify.com)


# Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS/SASS 
* jQuery
* slick.js (carousel on reviews section)
* Tilt.js (hover animation on contact image)
* wow.js (fade in blocks on business section)
* animate.css (fade in blocks on business section)
* Foundation Zurb (mobile first approach layout)
* Git (uploading source code)
* surge.sh (online static deployment)


# Approach

* Mobile first approach using Foundation Zurb

* For consistency:
- I have decided to apply the same margins or paddings to the elements which are repeated for instance on businessinfo and how it works sections.
- I have rounded all pixel with decimals to the nearest integer.

* Added slick.js for reviews section, it is a carousel where more than one review could be displayed, I have decided not to show buttons or arrows to respect the design.




# Wins and Blockers

Some sections were more challenging than others but it was a great experience overall.

# Future actions (with more time)

* Testing in different browsers and then amending or fixing accordingly by adding prefixes for all browsers support, checking how images behave and add any needed styles.

* Adding machtheight on the elements with diferent content size, for instance on repetitive blocks where the paragraph lenght may vary.

* Make the code DRYer.
